Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package
may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that
the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of
that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and
open to community adoption, improvement, and extension.

The intent of this license is to establish a freedom to share and improve the
software regulated by this License, not to restrict your rights to use it for
any purpose other than those that would violate the law or the rights of the
Copyright Holder.

Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) that owns the
copyright of the Package.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that creates, modifies, or distributes
any portion of the Package.

"You" means any person or entity who exercises any rights granted to them in
this License.

"Package" means the original work of software, as well as any additions,
changes, or modifications to that work, and any derivative works based on it.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified only in ways explicitly permitted by this License.

"Modified Version" means the Package after you have modified it in any way.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as distributed with the
Standard Version of the Package, in its current form or any subsequent
version that the Copyright Holder may release.

License Grant

The Copyright Holder hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license to exercise the following rights:

1. To use the Standard Version in any manner that does not violate the
   provisions of this License.

2. To modify the Package and create Modified Versions.

3. To distribute the Standard Version or Modified Versions, under the terms
   of this License.

4. To sublicense or distribute copies of the Modified Version to third parties.

Conditions for Distribution

You may distribute the Standard Version or Modified Versions of the Package
under the following conditions:

1. You must make sure that all recipients receive a copy of this License.

2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
   You changed the files.

3. You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
   from the Standard Version.

4. You may distribute your Modified Version as a standalone product, but if
   you do, you must clearly distinguish it from the Standard Version and
   rename it to avoid confusion with the original Package.

5. If the Modified Version includes any files that are part of the Standard
   Version, you must distribute them under the terms of this License.

6. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

Requirements for Modified Versions

If you create a Modified Version, you must meet the following conditions:

1. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Modified
   Version, or prominently display it in a location where users would easily
   find it.

2. You must make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder,
   and the Copyright Holder may include it in the Standard Version.

3. You must cause any Modified Version to prominently display a notice
   stating that it has been modified from the Standard Version.

Inability to Comply

If You cannot distribute the Modified Version while complying with all
requirements of this License, You may still distribute it, but you must:
(1) clearly indicate that it is a Modified Version, and (2) remove all
references to the Copyright Holder and the original Package from the
distribution, except that you may retain attribution notices in a manner
that makes it clear that the Modified Version is not the Standard Version.

Acceptance of Warranty

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Copyright
Holder provides the Package "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the Copyright Holder be liable for any direct, indirect,
incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages arising in any way
out of the use of the Package, even if advised of the possibility of such
damage.
